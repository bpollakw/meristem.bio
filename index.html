<h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Our research is focused streamlining and simplifying biological engineering in any organism. As part of this task, we developed the <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.15625" target="_blank" alt="Loop paper">Loop assembly</a> hierarchical and recursive Type IIS assembly system using two sets of restriction enzymes in two distinct levels of assembly, Odd and Even. 

    <br /><br />
    Loop allows facile DNA construction and we've extended its use to any organism by decoupling the assembly logic from plasmid elements required for propagation in target hosts. This version of Loop, called Universal Loop assembly (uLoop), has been used to enable genetic engineering in diatoms, yeast, plants and bacteria (prokarya and 3 superkingdoms of eukarya).
