<h3>Vision</h3>
    <p>We aim for tomorrow. Today, more than ever, we need better and quicker ways to enhance our production practices for a more sustainable fruit production. We need to find ways to improve our plants to increase yield with more efficient water and nutrient use, to be more nutricious and healthy, and to provide longer-lasting shelflife. </p> 
    <Br/>
    <p>We believe we can achieve that. In Mersitem we focus in developing the techniques and tools we need for making that future happen. State of the art molecular techniques, robotics and automation platforms, artificial intelligence data integration will pave the way to develop next-generation fruits cultivars.</p>
